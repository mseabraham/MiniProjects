# Gam3 Sp0t Project

### Description
Gam3 Sp0t is a program designed to provide a community platform for users to view game
details and post and view reviews. Users can create new accounts with different 
levels of access.

###### Accounts
- __*General Account:*__ These are the standard accounts on the application. If a user
creates one of these account then they are only able to view games, as well as upload
reviews on games they've played and would like to share their experience.
- __*Admin Account:*__ Admin has all the same capabilities as the general account but they
also have abilities for customisation of the platform. Admins are able to add, edit
and remove games from the platform, as well as modify developers and platforms for others
to apply to new games. Admins also have user management controls.
